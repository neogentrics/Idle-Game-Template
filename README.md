# Idle-Game-Template
First Game Template


This is my basic Idle game template as I learn how to code in Unity. 
Even though I am already familiar with C#.

If you can help me fix any of the errors in the code that would be appreciated.

Just updating and changing certain files. Outcome is still same.

All issues still remain.

**Update 2**

Changed system configs and reworked the Navigation as well as re-setup the scripts and setup.  However the underlying issue of the scroll bar is apparent. Will continuing working on a fix.

**Update 3**

Fixed the buttons and their displays as well as added the generator class's and objects. Had a few minor bug fixes to tweak the UI.

However the issue still remains with the UI Scrollbar not functioning as intended.

Will continue to debug and add more features.
