# Idle-Game-Template
First Game Template


This is my basic Idle game template as I learn how to code in Unity. 
Even though I am already familiar with C#.

If you can help me fix any of the errors in the code that would be appreciated.

Just updating and changing certain files. Outcome is still same.

All issues still remain.

**Update 3**

Fixed the buttons and their displays as well as added the generator class's and objects. Had a few minor bug fixes to tweak the UI.

However the issue still remains with the UI Scrollbar not functioning as intended.

Will continue to debug and add more features.

**Update 4**

Implemented some bug fixes for minor issues in Unity and the scripts. 

All scripts were updated to the latest C# v10 on .Net 6.0 in Visual Studio 2022

-> Added

Save States and Load States for PlayerData After Implementation the game failed to relaunch after the initial attempt. 

-> Bug Found 

Visual Studio 2022 sees no issues in the code. However I am receiving an error in Unity Ver. 2020.3.28f1

Is this issue due to great a difference in software compatibility or is there a random line of code nor setup properly.
